# QuickBill

The application aims to facilitate invoicing for entrepreneurs and provide easy access to viewing and editing invoices. Each registered user in the application has their own list of invoices, which other users do not have access to. After logging in, the user can see statistics of their invoices in a given period, along with a revenue graph. They can add a new invoice, including goods for which the total amount and tax will be calculated automatically. After entering all the necessary data, the user can generate a PDF file. Users can also view all their previously issued invoices and filter them by specifying appropriate parameters. All data is saved in a database

The application saves data in a local database due to project requirements for university studies. Eventually, a REST API backend would be created.

## Technologies:
* Java
* JavaFx
